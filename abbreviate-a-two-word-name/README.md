Instructions from Code Wars for Abbreviate a two word name:
    Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes
    two words with one space in between them.

    The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

    It should look like this:

    Sam Harris => S.H

    Patrick Feeney => P.F
